<h1>Self-Stabilizing Algorithms</h1>
<h2>First three algorithms based on the paper "Self-Stabilizing Algorithms for Unfriendly Partitions" by Sandra Hedetniemi, Stephen Hedetniemi, K.E. Kennedy, and Alice McRae.</h2>
<h2>Last algorithm based on the paper "Maximal matching stabilizes in time O(m)" by Stephen Hedetniemi, David Jacobs, Pradip K. Srimani.</h2>
<p>This code implements the four algorithms discussed in the papers listed above.</p>
